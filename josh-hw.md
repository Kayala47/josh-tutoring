# Homework 

## Week of 6/18
Your homework was to come up with an idea for how to display a win/loss screen, using Pygame documentation for keyboard presses. In session, we went over how to get the game to recognize when you've pressed a button, and we talked about how you might prompt the user to click a certain button to keep playing and another one to quit. 

### Status: *Attempted* - issue with black screen loading; disappears too fast
