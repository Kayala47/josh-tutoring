HTML/CSS Lesson:

html is for structure, and CSS is for style. 
- html controls what is in the page, css is how it looks
(Javascript is functionality: movement, interaction, background)

Structure of a webpage: (HTML)

- tags
	open tag and a close tag that work together. They surround
	an element to tell html what that element is

- structure
	html tag, then head tag, then body tag
	in the body, you can put all the elements that you want to be 
	seen on the page
	
	in the head, you only put elements that are important to the browser 
	but CANNOT be seen

- important tags:
	HTML
	head
	body
	headers: 1 - 6...
	paragraphs
	div

- Classes and IDs
	classes - can be assigned using the class="" attribute, and 
	you can add a class to any element and any number of elements
	
	ID - specific name for a tag. Can only be given to one thing


Styling (CSS):
 - CSS = Cascading Style Sheet

	using CSS, we can select elements from the page and give them
	a specific style (color, shape, size, etc.)

	Rule: more specific beats less specific and further down on
	on page beats higher up on page
		- ID > classes > tags
	. = class
	# = ID
