We've just made both paddles work separately

Next Steps:
- get pictures their own names & position them
- make sure it actually gets misses correctly. 
- scoreboard: count every miss & assign points
	- code to keep track of points
	- GUI - graphical user interface. A scoreboard that looks nice & 
		can update itself
- make one of the paddles independent (AI)
	- ask players if they want to play 1 or 2 player game
