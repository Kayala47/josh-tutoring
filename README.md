# Hi Josh! #

New update: you'll now find your weekly homeworks under the josh-hw file. I'll update that weekly and keep track of whether you've done it. 

Here's the Zoom link: https://pomonacollege.zoom.us/j/83591806691
Hey josh! Haven't seen you log on - please use the zoom link :)

As you can see, I've made some changes. This README file will now be used to host announcements, and your weekly homework. I've transferred all the definitons we created into the definitons.txt file, so you can always access those there. 

Your homework this week:
- make a button that launches the fireball!
