# Hi Josh! #

New update: you'll now find your weekly homeworks under the josh-hw file. I'll update that weekly and keep track of whether you've done it. 

Here's the whereby link: https://whereby.com/kayala

Here's the Zoom link: https://pomonacollege.zoom.us/j/96946769929

As you can see, I've made some changes. This README file will now be used to host announcements, and your weekly homework. I've transferred all the definitons we created into the definitons.txt file, so you can always access those there. 

Your homework this week:
- Add all the animal classes as a separate class that extends Animal, and give them all their different variables
- Add appropriate variables to the Worker class, such as name, salary, etc. 
Next week, I will show you how these will interact with each other and with the Zoo :)
