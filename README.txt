Hi Josh! This is where I'll put all of your pop-quiz material. Consider this your text book. For next week(as of 11/5/19), fill this out with the info you know. I will correct it before our next meeting. 

Dictionary:
there is a key and a value the key is what the person types and the value is the thing they get. you can flip  them. there are also a tuppel. but a very big one that can hold a lot. it is like a in then output system so if i were to type hello then it would give me back what the value is for hello
-Josh

Two things: 
- You CAN'T flip them. That's why we wrote a function to do it. There is no built-in way to do it
- It is NOT a tuple. A tuple is specifically (a,b). This structure is: {key:value}. Can also be referred to as a Hashmap.
-Kevin

Tuple:Are two obeject that you can send together to unpack or use both at the samw time.
-Josh
Array: Array is a list of stuff not the list in code but a list of somthing.
-Josh
List: List is ia like aarray but instead you can't change the stuff in it for like hackers
-Josh

Int: Int is a number but it is a whole number and a thing that is already a thing that the computer knows and also byte wich is more that 8 letters.
-Josh
String:String is a word made out of char and a object.

Char:Char is a easier word for character and means letter of a word.
-Josh
Float:Float is a number but not a whole number like a decimal number.
-Josh
Long:
- a bigger number that can store larger values. Int has a limit for how big of a number it can hold, but long does not. 
 --Kevin

Function:
(both types)
Void: is a fuction where you got to call the function then it would give you somthing.
return: is a fuction where you don't have to call it would just do it after you run it, and uses the keyword return.

Loops:
(Two types)
For: For loops are loops but you say how many times, like 10 ten times or 20 time.
Wheile: Wheile loops is a loop where there is a condition like do it until the room is clean or somthing else.
