Hi Josh! This is where I'll put all of your pop-quiz material. Consider this your text book. For next week(as of 11/5/19), fill this out with the info you know. I will correct it before our next meeting. 

Dictionary:
there is a key and a value the key is what the person types and the value is the thing they get. you can flip  them. there are also a tuppel. but a very big one that can hold a lot. it is like a in then output system so if i were to type hello then it would give me back what the value is for hello
-Josh

Two things: 
- You CAN'T flip them. That's why we wrote a function to do it. There is no built-in way to do it
- It is NOT a tuple. A tuple is specifically (a,b). This structure is: {key:value}. Can also be referred to as a Hashmap.

Tuple:

Array:

List:

Int:

String:

Char:

Float:

Long:
- a bigger number that can store larger values. Int has a limit for how big of a number it can hold, but long does not.

Function:
