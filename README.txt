Hi Josh! This is where I'll put all of your pop-quiz material. Consider this your text book. For next week(as of 11/5/19), fill this out with the info you know. I will correct it before our next meeting. 

Dictionary:
     there is a key and a value the key is what the person types and the value is the thing they get. you can flip  them. there are also a tuppel. but a very big one that can hold a lot. it is like a in then output system so if i were to type hello then it would give me back what the value is for hello
     -Josh

     Two things: 
     - You CAN'T flip them. That's why we wrote a function to do it. There is no built-in way to do it
     - It is NOT a tuple. A tuple is specifically (a,b). This structure is: {key:value}. Can also be referred to as a Hashmap.
     -Kevin

Tuple:

      Are two obejects that you can send together to unpack or use both at the samw time.
      -Josh
      
      Always use parenthesis (). 
      - Kevin


Array: 

     Array is a list of stuff not the list in code but a list of somthing.
     -Josh
     
     An array is a COLLECTION of objects. You can modify the objects inside, delete them, remove something, add something, and 
     you can search for it and index it. 
       Index - so for ex: array[0] gives the first object in the collection
       
     Marked by brackets
     - Kevin


List: 

      List is ia like aarray but instead you can't change the stuff in it for like hackers
      -Josh

     Lists are immutable. That means they cannot change. Good for security. 
     Marked by parenthesis ()
     -Kevin
     
Int: 
     Int is a number but it is a whole number and a thing that is already a thing that the computer knows and also byte wich is more that 8 letters.
     -Josh
     
     Ints are PRIMITIVES, which means that they are NOT objects and require less memory. They can be stored in 24 bytes. 8 bits per byte, which means 8 * 24 bits total.
     
     
String:
  String is a word made out of char and a object.
  - Josh
  
  Strings are COLLECTIONS of characters. Can be indexed. "Word"[0] == W is true
  - Kevin

Char:

     Char is a easier word for character and means letter of a word.
     -Josh
     
     A Character is a single letter or symbol. You can string characters togethere to make a word or String.
     chars are primitives. Don't have to be created. And they take up less space. 
    
     
Float:

       Float is a number but not a whole number like a decimal number.
       -Josh
       
       The reason they are called floats is because the decimal number is "floating". 
       
       Floats are sometimes called Doubles. 
       - Kevin
Long:
      - a bigger number that can store larger values. Int has a limit for how big of a number it can hold, but long does not. 

      usually an integer. 
       --Kevin

Function:
     (both types)
     Void: is a fuction where you got to call the function then it would give you somthing.
     return: is a fuction where you don't have to call it would just do it after you run it, and uses the keyword return.
     
     Wrong. 
     You always havfe to call a function for it to do something! You do that by putting parenthesis after the function name. 
     Ex: function()
     
     Void - means "nothing". Returns nothing. It does something and then stops.Process completed. 
     Return - returns something. It gives a value back to whoever called it. This value can be stored. 

     -Kevin
Loops:
      (Two types)
      For: For loops are loops but you say how many times, like 10 ten times or 20 time.
      Wheile: Wheile loops is a loop where there is a condition like do it until the room is clean or somthing else.
     - Josh
     
     For loops take an iterable condition. 
      Iterate - to go through something. Iterable means that something can be searched through. You can go through each element
      
     While loops take a boolean condition. Stops when the condition is either true or false. 
    
Primitives:
     
     are built-in in each language. This means that they don't require any extra effort to create. Also take less space because
     they only have the bare minium information. 

Objects: 

   Objects are created by the user. They usually have more information, including functions. This takes up more space. 
   
   char 'a'
   String "abcde...z"
   
   char.split()#they don't havfe this function
   String.split()#string has built in functions, which each take up space
   -Kevin
   
Scope & Hierarchy:
scope is when even thought you might need somthing ahead that your code.
